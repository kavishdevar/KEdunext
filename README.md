# Pydunext
## A 3rd party (WIP) API/App/Website for the Edunext School ERP for students.
### This is a work in progress project. I am not affiliated with Edunext in any way.
### This project is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with Edunext.

- **Alpha** features are in-development and may have many frequent breaking changes.
- **Beta** features are mostly polished and ready for use (but you'll have to figure how to use it yourself).
- **Stable** features are reviewed, documented, and ready for use.
